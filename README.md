This is a game in which rotating black/white squares appear in random coordinates of the screen.

To score points click on the white squares. All of your clicks on the screen leave a red "shadow". If a black square touches your shadow you lose the game.

So in essence the point of the game is to click on the white squares when they appear and in the meantime hide your "shadow" from the black ones by clicking on empty/corner areas of the screen. The game, of course, speeds up as time goes by in order to make your life miserable.
